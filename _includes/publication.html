<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Previous research claims that public awareness of censorship will lead to backlash against the regime. However, surveys around the world consistently find that citizens in authoritarian regimes are apathetic toward or even supportive of government censorship. To explain this puzzle, I theorize that citizens are subject to a process of normalization. Specifically, individuals become desensitized to censorship when the range of censored content expands beyond politically threatening topics like government criticism and collective action to other seemingly harmless non-political issues. Using around 28 million censored posts and articles on the two largest social media platforms in China and two original survey experiments, I show that (1) a majority of censored articles are unrelated to politically threatening topics, and (2) respondents exposed to the censorship of both political and non-political content report less backlash and higher support for the censorship apparatus and the regime than those only exposed to political censorship. These findings highlight how the normalization of repressive policies such as censorship contributes to authoritarian control and survival.                    </p>

<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Contrary to the conventional top-down view of government censorship, ordinary citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently participate in censorship by reporting online content. This study theorizes a bottom-up perspective of censorship in authoritarian regimes and analyzes its prevalence and consequences on public opinion toward censorship in the case of China. I argue that public participation increases support for censorship by diminishing the government's responsibility and strengthening citizens' perceived empowerment. Using an original survey in China, I show that more than half of the respondents have flagged content online and such participation is positively correlated with support for government censorship. I further conducted an experiment embedded in custom-engineered, simulated social media pages. Consistent with my theory, respondents that are encouraged to report simulated posts display significantly higher support for government censorship. My study highlights the role of ordinary citizens in facilitating authoritarian control and the normalization of repressive policies such as censorship.                    </p>

<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
  This study examines how the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent Western responses to the invasion influence
public opinion on the use of military force in China. Using two original, pre-registered survey experiments, 
        first in June 2022 and then in June 2023, we show that the Russian aggression increases Chinese support for using military force in international affairs in general and against Taiwan in particular.
        However, information about Western military measures aiding Ukraine curbs the emboldening impact of the invasion. 
        Such information is especially effective in diminishing support for an outright military invasion of Taiwan. 
        Causal mediation analyses reveal that the Russian invasion influences public opinion by inducing optimistic expectations of military success and pessimistic expectations of peaceful conflict resolution. 
        These findings underline the possibility that authoritarian military aggression abroad and subsequent Western reactions can influence public opinion toward using military force in other autocracies.

<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
When do authoritarian regimes intensify emotions in their propaganda?
In this study, we posit that higher emotional intensity signals the importance of propaganda messages. Specifically, when propagandists speak, their voices are a combination of manipulable and sincere emotional elements. Important propaganda messages are delivered with higher emotional intensity both due to deliberate attempts to arouse emotions among the public and the subconscious emotional disposition of the propagandists. To test which components of propaganda are intensified in emotions, we employ novel audio-as-data methods to collect and analyze three years of original audio recordings of China's flagship propaganda program.
Specifically, we generate audio-based measures: vocal pitch for emotional intensity and text transcripts for substantive propaganda content. 
We find that propaganda materials related to China's leader Xi Jinping and repressive institutions are associated with higher emotional intensity. In contrast, the regime's policy achievements and negative coverage of foreign countries are associated with lower emotional intensity.
Our study sheds light on the coercive nature of China's propaganda strategies and extends the audio-as-data method to the Chinese language and the study of authoritarian politics.
