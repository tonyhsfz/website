<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Censorship in authoritarian regimes has traditionally been understood as a repressive tool of the government and therefore unpopular among the public.
        However, surveys around the world consistently find that citizens in authoritarian regimes are apathetic toward or even supportive of government censorship.
        To explain this puzzle, I theorize that citizens are subject to a process of normalization.
        Specifically, individuals become desensitized to censorship activities when the range of censored content expands beyond politically threatening topics, like government criticism and collective action, to other seemingly harmless non-political issues.
        Using 28 million censored posts on the two largest social media platforms in China and two original survey experiments on Chinese citizens, I show that (1) a majority of censored articles are indeed unrelated to politically threatening topics, and (2) respondents exposed to the censorship of both political and non-political content report less backlash and higher support for the censorship apparatus and the regime than those exposed only to political censorship.
        These findings highlight how the normalization of repressive apparatuses such as censorship contributes to authoritarian control and survival.

<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
 This study examines how the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent Western responses influence Chinese public opinion on the use of force.
        Using two original, preregistered online survey experiments, first in June 2022 and then in June 2023,
        we show that the Russian invasion is associated with a modest but statistically significant increase in Chinese support for using military force in international affairs in general and against Taiwan in particular.
        However, information on Western military measures aiding Ukraine curbs the modest impact of the invasion.
        Such information is especially effective in reducing support for an outright military invasion of Taiwan.
        Causal mediation analyses reveal that the Russian invasion influences public opinion by inducing optimism regarding military success and pessimism regarding peaceful resolution of the conflict.
        These findings suggest that foreign military aggression and subsequent international countermeasures can sway domestic public opinion on using military force.</p>

<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Contrary to the conventional top-down view of government censorship, ordinary citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently participate in censorship by reporting online content.
        This study theorizes a bottom-up perspective of censorship in authoritarian regimes and analyzes its prevalence and consequences on public opinion toward censorship in the case of China.
        I argue that public participation increases support for censorship by diminishing the government's responsibility and strengthening citizens' perceived empowerment.
        Using an original survey in China, I show that more than half of the respondents have flagged content online and such participation is positively correlated with support for government censorship.
        I further conducted an experiment embedded in custom-engineered, simulated social media pages. Consistent with my theory, respondents that are encouraged to report simulated posts display significantly higher support for government censorship.
        My study highlights the role of ordinary citizens in facilitating authoritarian control and the normalization of repressive policies such as censorship.                    </p>
