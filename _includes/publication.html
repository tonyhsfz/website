<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Previous research claims that public awareness of censorship will lead to backlash against the regime. However, surveys consistently find that Chinese citizens are apathetic toward or even supportive of government censorship. To explain this puzzle, I argue that citizens are subject to a process of normalization. Specifically, individuals become desensitized to censorship when the range of censored content expands beyond politically threatening topics like government criticism and collective action to other seemingly harmless non-political issues. Using a dataset of 15,872 censored articles on WeChat and an original survey experiment in China, I show that (1) a majority of censored articles are unrelated to politically threatening topics, and (2) respondents exposed to the censorship of both political and non-political content display less backlash toward the regime and its censorship policy than those who were only exposed to political censorship. My findings highlight how normalization of repressive policies contributes to authoritarian control.

<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Contrary to the conventional top-down view of government censorship, ordinary citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently participate in censorship by reporting online content. This study theorizes a bottom-up perspective of censorship in authoritarian regimes and analyzes its prevalence and consequences on public opinion toward censorship in the case of China. I argue that public participation increases support for censorship by diminishing the government's responsibility and strengthening citizens' perceived empowerment. Using an original survey in China, I show that more than half of the respondents have flagged content online and such participation is positively correlated with support for government censorship. I further conducted an experiment embedded in custom-engineered, simulated social media pages. Consistent with my theory, respondents that are encouraged to report simulated posts display significantly higher support for government censorship. My study highlights the role of ordinary citizens in facilitating authoritarian control and the normalization of repressive policies such as censorship.                    </p>

<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Which components of propaganda do authoritarian regimes deliver with higher emotional intensity? In this study, we posit that delivery is a unique dimension of authoritarian propaganda, and analyzing delivery allows us to gauge the priority of regime propaganda strategies. Specifically, a higher vocal pitch of propagandists reflects higher emotional intensity associated with the propaganda materials, which implies issue importance. Focusing on the case of China, we collect three years of original audio recordings from Xinwen Lianbo, a flagship propaganda program, and construct audio-based measures of emotional intensity using vocal pitch. We then use structural topic models and word-embedding methods to identify different propaganda topics and keywords. We find that topics related to Xi Jinping and coercive apparatus are delivered with higher emotional intensity. Our study sheds light on the coercive nature of China's propaganda strategies and extends the audio-as-date method to the Chinese language and the study of authoritarian politics.                        </p>
