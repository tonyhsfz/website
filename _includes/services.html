<p> Abstract </p>
<p>
Previous research claims that public awareness of censorship will lead to backlash against the regime. However, surveys consistently find that Chinese citizens are apathetic or even supportive of the government's censorship policy. To explain this puzzle, I argue that citizens are subject to a process of normalization. Specifically, individuals become desensitized to censorship when the range of censored content expands beyond politically threatening topics like government criticism and collective action to other seemingly harmless non-political issues. Using a dataset of 15,872 censored articles on WeChat and an original survey experiment in China, I show that (1) a majority of censored articles are unrelated to politically threatening topics, and (2) respondents exposed to both political and non-political censorship display less backlash toward the regime and its censorship policy than those who were only exposed to political censorship. My findings highlight normalization as a powerful tool of authoritarian control.
