                <p class="text-faded">I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at <a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. I study comparative politics and political psychology. Specifically, I am interested in authoritarian politics, protest movements, repression, censorship, and social media. Methodologically, I use a wide range of research methods, including formal modeling, observational quantitative analysis, and randomized experiments. I have regional expertise in greater China and Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">My recent paper on censorship in China proposes a new way of understanding censorship and authoritarian control. I highlight the importance of normalization as a powerful strategy of authoritarian control that reduces backlash from the citizens caused by repressive policies.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">In my dissertation, I study why some protesters engage in violent activities during protest movements while others refrain from violence.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">In summer 2021, I will receive my A.M. degree in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to joining Washington University, I received an LL.B. degree in Law from Renmin University of China.</p>
