                <p class="text-faded">I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at <a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. I study comparative politics and political behavior. Specifically, I am interested in authoritarian politics, government censorship, propaganda, popular protest, and political repression. Methodologically, I use a wide range of research methods, including formal modeling, randomized experiments, and computational methods (text-as-data and audio-as-data). I have regional expertise in East and Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">My recent paper on censorship in China proposes a new way of understanding censorship and authoritarian control. My study highlights the normalization of coercive policies, such as censorship, as a powerful channel through which authoritarian regimes achieve social control. My dissertation project builds on this censorship paper and studies public support for government censorship in China from multiple different angles. Apart from censorship, I also have projects in progress concerning propaganda, emotions, and public opinion toward the use of force in China and other authoritarian regimes.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">In 2021, I received my A.M. degree in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to joining Washington University, I received an LL.B. degree in Law from Renmin University of China.</p>
